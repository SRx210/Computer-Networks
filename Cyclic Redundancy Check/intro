# Note!!
The code provided consists of two functions for the receiver's side for error detection, i.e., Without Error and With Error.
The With Error one consists of simulated codeword... In general, due to artifacts (such as noise), errors occur within the bits.
So when executing the code, make sure to comment out either one of them.
